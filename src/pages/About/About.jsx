        <p className="about"> My mission is to create a website that will help all LGBTQIA and QPOC communities. I see a lot of people
            struggling with this, be it, getting kicked out for being themselves and/or getting denied services or even being killed.
            I am transgender myself and I want to help as many people as I can through their own journies. If you click on your 
            identitys flag in the dropdown menu, you will find resources that may help you. If you are a signed in user you are able to 
            go to your specific identity page and make posts for others to see! The youth is not the only part of these communities
            suffering and I am here to create this website for support for ALL ages!
